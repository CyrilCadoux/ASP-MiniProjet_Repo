Gitbook : voir avec Eric pour savoir ce qu'on doit mettre dedans.


Intro pitch shifting :

- Motivation
- Real Time constraint (ask Eric about high pitch shifting in real time) => We approximate real time (not bit by bit)
- Efficiency : use int numbers and look up tables


Robot voice:
- Explain SIN table
- Explain direct component and how to remove it
- Simple modulation
- Explain the double length buffer for the C/board implementation


Grain Synthesis:
- Global Idea
- Explain resample and why we cannot do it for high pitching
	(Explain the need of interpolation and LookUp Tables)
	(Explain that we perform up sampling)
- Motivate the need of the window
- Explain why down + up window on the same samples is different than not modifying the samples
- Explain implementation details (global variables and shared buffers)

LPC:
-Global Idea does not depend on Grain Systhesis
- This is not a pitch shifting method. It is only used to make the result seem more natural
- Explain LPC
- We perform pitch shifting with GS
- Explain the implementatin (with fake code) and what differs with the basic GS approach.
